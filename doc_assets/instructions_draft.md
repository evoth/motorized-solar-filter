Steps:
1. **3D print the four parts.**
    - The settings shouldn't matter too much, but make sure there isn't excessive support material that will be difficult to remove (the servo holder is usually the biggest culprit). Since I used a service at my college to print them, I'm not sure which settings they used, but I think it was around 0.2mm layer height and 15% infill.
2. **Cut a circle of circle film about 70-80mm in diameter.**
    - I used a roll of blue tape as a stencil, but as long as it can fit inside the outer filter piece without moving around too much, it should be fine.
3. **Place the solar film in the filter outer piece.**
    - The side that's supposed to face the sun (usually the shinier side if there is one) should face towards the base, away from the walls of the filter.
4. **Place the filter inner piece within the outer piece.**
    - They should fit snugly together and sandwich the film, leaving only a thin gap.
    - *Note: Make 100% sure there's no way that light can get through, even if you shake the filter. It's your responsibility to keep you and your equipment safe!*
5. **Fix the inner and outer pieces together.**
    - I used blue tape, but glue would also work. However, I recommend using a non-permanent method in case the solar film gets damaged and you need to replace it.
6. **Attach the servo to the servo holder.**
    - Use the included screws to screw it in.
    - The side with the gear must be on the side with the shorter post so that it's in line with the cylindrical piece on the other side!
7. **Attach the filter to the servo.**
    - Slide the filter into 
7. **Cut a piece of elastic strap about 35cm long (can always cut it shorter later).**
