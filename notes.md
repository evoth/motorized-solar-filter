## Version 1

**Functionality:**
- Filter (Outer):
    - Satisfactory.
- Filter (Inner):
    - Does not fit servo arm (recess is too narrow and short).
- Servo holder:
    - Screws were too hard to turn.
    - Servo is not securely mounted.
- Tri-glide:
    - Satisfactory.

**Recommendations:**
- Filter (Outer):
    - Wall thickness can be decreased to reduce weight.
- Filter (Inner):
    - Wall thickness can be decreased to reduce weight. 
    - Redesign servo arm recess to fit measured dimensions of hardware.
- Servo holder:
    - Make the supports thicker with a tighter clearance for the motor.
    - Enlarge the screw holes for easier installation.
    - Add a hook on the bottom support to hold the servo cable.
